# BB_Challenge
Using provided data to create a simple static website. For practice
Started out by creating the different aspects of the website and testing the different functions as they were created. 
Once done with the 3 basic functions I went back to add color to the site (dark green for bacteria) just so the website had a bit more personallity 
Really shines in google chrome dark mode
